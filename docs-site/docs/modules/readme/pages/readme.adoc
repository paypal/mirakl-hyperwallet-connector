A sample .env file is provided in this repository, primarily for use in the Docker container deployment scenario (
documented below). The .env file can also be used to source environment variables for use in local deployment, if you
prefer to store these in a file. If you do this, remember that for local deployment you will still need to properly
export/source the variables from the file and into the executing shell.

### Property Files

This is a multi-module Gradle project composed by Spring Boot
modules https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html[Official gradle Documentation]

Every module contains a configuration file located under the `MODULE_NAME/src/main/resources` folder path.

All configuration should be done by setting environment variables, as described in the table above.

The module configuration files listed below contain properties that retrieve their values directly from environment
variables. The modules and their configuration files are described here, for troubleshooting purposes or to support
advanced configuration & deployment:

- **sellers**: Synchronises seller information between Mirakl and Hyperwallet.
- **kyc**: Manages incoming notifications from Hyperwallet for KYC purposes.
- **invoices**: Distributes funds to sellers based on Mirakl's invoices and manual credit notes, and processes commissions for the operator.
- **notifications**: Receives incoming webhook notifications from Hyperwallet and forwards them for further processing by other modules.
- **reports**: Generates the CSV report from invoices and manual credit notes from Mirakl and Braintree transactions.
- **infrastructure**: Contains common functionality used by the rest of the modules.
- **web**: Centralises the startup of the web application and exposes all the endpoints for manually running the cron jobs.

## Execution and Deployment

The connector can either be deployed locally, or with a container.

To ease testing & initial deployment, we strongly recommend to start with the containerized version using Docker Compose
and the provided templates.

### Local

For local execution you will need to build the connector and start it up with the following commands:

* `./gradlew build`
* `./gradlew web:bootRun`

We strongly recommend for testing and development purposes to use the containerized version with Docker Compose,
explained in the following sections.

#### Running whole stack with Docker Compose

To make it easier to run the application, as it depends on multiple services, a Docker Compose configuration exists
within the project.

#### Building the Docker image with Docker Compose

The Docker image will create the file `docker-compose.yml`, which is based on the `docker-compose.yml.template` file:

`./gradlew buildDockerCompose`

#### Executing Docker container with Docker Compose

This Gradle task will run the Docker image based on the generated `docker-compose.yml` file:

`./gradlew dockerComposeUp`

The Docker deploy uses the .env file to apply all the mandatory environment variables defined
previously link:#_configuration[in the environment variables table]

Make sure your .env file contains all the mandatory environment variables, otherwise the connector will not be able to
start.

To check for configuration issues run:
`docker-compose --env-file .env config` and see if the variables are all correctly set.

https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/#:~:text=DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY-,Notes,-Values%20present%20in[For more about how Docker Compose uses .env files, consult the official documentation.]

Optionally, you can pass arguments to Docker Compose with the property `dockerComposeArgs`:

`./gradlew dockerCompose -P dockerComposeArgs='up -d'`

This will start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Production build

In order to generate a Docker Compose ready to be used in production, the build command needs the property `prod` set
to `true`:

`./gradlew buildDockerCompose -P prod=true`

## Operator Commissions

By default, the operator commissions feature is enabled. This is set in the
property `invoices.operator.commissions.enabled` in the `invoices.properties` file. This feature can be disabled by
setting the value of this property to `false`.

## Program Configuration

### Single Program (Default)

The default setup provides a single-level hierarchy where one Issuing Merchant corresponds to one Issuing Store.

This is defined in Mirakl using the `hw-program` shop custom field (see the Mirakl Configuration section in the Solution
Guide), which for a single hierarchy program should contain a single value list with only one value `DEFAULT`.

The described environment variables dependant on the field `hw-program` mentioned on the setup step are designed for
this hierarchy type.

### Multiple Programs

The Hyperwallet, Mirakl, and HMC configurations can be extended to accommodate a multiple program hierarchy structure,
where one Issuing Merchant can have multiple Issuing Stores.

Based on Hyperwallet's configuration, it will be necessary to modify the Hyperwallet Program configuration.

By default, HMC supports just one. Just in case it is needed multiple values, we need to do some easy modifications.

For example:

* We have two different Hyperwallet programs: UK and Europe.
* We defined in Mirakl a custom attribute which label is `hw-program` as `SingleValueList` with these values: `EUROPE`
  and `UK`

In that case, we need to setup the following variables as described:

* Environment:
** Define variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKENS` with value `UK,EUROPE`

* File: `invoices.properties`:
** Remove `invoices.hyperwallet.api.hyperwalletprogram.token.DEFAULT` property
** Remove `invoices.operator.commissions.bankAccount.token.DEFAULT` property
** Define token for UK: `invoices.hyperwallet.api.hyperwalletprogram.token.UK=<YOUR_UK_TOKEN>`
** Define token for EUROPE: `invoices.hyperwallet.api.hyperwalletprogram.token.EUROPE=<YOUR_EUROPE_TOKEN>`
** Define the operator bank account token for UK: `invoices.operator.commissions.bankAccount.token.UK = <YOUR_UK_BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>`
** Define the operator bank account token for EUROPE: `invoices.operator.commissions.bankAccount.token.EUROPE = <YOUR_EUROPE_BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN>`

* File: `infrastructure.properties`:
** Remove `infrastructure.hyperwallet.api.hyperwalletprogram.token.DEFAULT`
** Define token for UK: `infrastructure.hyperwallet.api.hyperwalletprogram.token.UK=<YOUR_UK_TOKEN>`
** Define token for EUROPE: `infrastructure.hyperwallet.api.hyperwalletprogram.token.EUROPE=<YOUR_EUROPE_TOKEN>`

If you're using Docker, remember to update the Docker Compose template file to reflect the existence of these 2 new environments.Add them into the Docker Compose template file you're using (`docker-compose.prod.yml.template`
or `docker-compose.yml.template`), for example with UK and Europe:

- `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKEN_PAYMENTS_UK`
- `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKEN_USERS_UK`
- `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKEN_PAYMENTS_EUROPE`
- `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKEN_USERS_EUROPE`

Besides, if you had the necessity of adapting the property files to accommodate this kind of hierarchy you can make use of https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.5/reference/html/howto.html#howto-externalize-configuration[environment variables substitution feature built in with Spring
Boot]

This way the tokens would be store in a safe manner.

### Ignoring Programs

Sometimes we don't want the connector to process all the shops from Mirakl (and their associated invoices). In that case
we can use programs to exclude those shops from being processed.

To do this, we need to set up the following environment variable:

- `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_IGNORED_PROGRAM_TOKENS`

with the list of programs that we want to ignore. The programs in this list must be a subset of the programs defined
in `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKENS`.

Continuing with the same example described in the _Multiple Programs_ section, if we would like to exclude `UK` shops
for being processed by the connector, we should simply set `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_IGNORED_PROGRAM_TOKENS` to `UK`.

## Financial Reporting

The Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector has the ability to generate a financial report, compiling information from the Mirakl
and Braintree platforms.

For enabling this functionality you will need to add the `financial-report` value to the `PAYPAL_SPRING_PROFILE_ACTIVE`,
for example: `PAYPAL_SPRING_PROFILE_ACTIVE=dev,financial-report`.

## Setting up jobs

The Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector runs jobs to perform various integrations between the Hyperwallet and Mirakl platforms.

* `Individual sellers extract job`: Extracts the individual seller information from Mirakl and creates it on Hyperwallet.
* `Professional sellers extract job`: Extracts the professional seller information from Mirakl and creates it on
  Hyperwallet.
* `Bank Accounts extract job`: Extracts the bank detail information from sellers and creates a bank on account
  Hyperwallet associated to the corresponding user in Hyperwallet.
* `Invoices extract job`: Extracts the bank detail information from sellers and creates a bank on account
  Hyperwallet associated to the corresponding user in Hyperwallet.
* `Failed notifications retry job`: Retries all of the notifications sent from Hyperwallet that failed while being processed.

Those jobs are currently setup across the properties file as this table follows:

|===
|Property|Cron expression|Properties file
| `sellers.extractsellers.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 0 0 1/1 * ? *   | `sellers/src/main/resources/sellers.properties`             
| `sellers.extractprofessionalsellers.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 0 0 1/1 * ? *   | `sellers/src/main/resources/sellers.properties`             
| `sellers.bankaccountextract.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 30 0 1/1 * ? *  | `sellers/src/main/resources/sellers.properties`             
| `invoices.extractinvoices.scheduling.cronexpression`| 1 0 0 1/1 * ? *   | `invoices/src/main/resources/invoices.properties`           
| `notifications.retryfailed.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 0/15 * * * ? *  | `notifications/src/main/resources/notifications.properties` 
|===

The existing jobs can be executed manually through their endpoints. Except for notification retry job, which doesn't receive
any parameter, all endpoints support 2 optional parameters:

* `delta`: When provided for an extract job, the job will only process entities that were updated/created after this
  date
* `name` : When provided, the job will be given this name


|===
|Param|Format
|`name`| String
|`delta`| yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX
|===

Endpoints:
|===
|  HTTP Method   | PATH                                  | Job type                     
| `POST`         | `/job/sellers-extract`                | Individual Sellers extract   
| `POST`         | `/job/professional-sellers-extract`   | Professional Sellers extract 
| `POST`         | `/job/bank-accounts-extract`          | Bank accounts extract        
| `POST`         | `/job/invoices-extract`               | Invoices extract             
| `POST`         | `/job//process-failed-notifications`  | Retry failed notifications   
|===
See example of valid execution request:
[example]
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/job/bank-accounts-extract?delta=2020-11-22T11:52:00.000-00:00&name=bankAccountExtractJob'



### Calculating delta in extract jobs

The different extract jobs (individual sellers extract job, invoices extract job, etc.) makes requests to Mirakl to
retrieve the entities that have changed since a specific date. When the jobs are triggered by the cron expessions this
initial date for retrieving changes (known as delta) is automatically calculated. Jobs automatically sets the initial
time for searching entities in Mirakl to the time of the last successful execution of the job that returned Mirakl
entities.

There is a maximum days to look in the past when the connector makes a Mirakl request to retrieve the changed entities,
which can be set using the environment variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_JOB_EXTRACTION_MAXDAYS` (defaults to 30).

### Retry Jobs

In addition to standard jobs, Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector also has jobs for retrying items that have failed during the
execution of the standard jobs.

Every time the processing of an item fails (for example an individual seller), the information of the failed item is
stored in the database and a retry job for that item type will reprocess it later. The retry job will attempt to reprocess
items periodically, being the time of the next attempt calculated according to this expression
`Item Last Failure Time + (30 minutes * number of attempts)`. A maximum of 5 attempts is made for each item.

Retry jobs executes periodically with a higher frequency than standard jobs, so they can reprocess the failed items as
soon as possible respecting the calculated time of the next retry. The periodicity of these jobs can be customized
modifying this properties, althoug is recommended to keep the default values:

|===
| Property                                         |  Cron expression  | Properties file

## Webhook Notifications

The Hyperwallet platform is capable of sending event notifications via webhook. This connector comes with a built-in
listener to process supported webhook notification types, and works with both basic authentication and payload
encryption.

The endpoint for the webhook listener is on the path: `/webhooks/notifications`. This path is used by default, and no
properties or configuration are used for enabling or setting up the webhook listener.

During the on-boarding process, Hyperwallet will enable webhook notifications by registering the webhook listener
endpoint URL (for example, https://hmc.example.com/webhooks/notifications).

Storing and querying notifications:

The connector stores the incoming notifications, these can be retrieved and deleted using these endpoints.
A `from` and a `to` date parameters must be provided in both operations.

## Payload Encryption

This connector supports payload encryption for connecting with https://docs.hyperwallet.com/content/api/v4/overview/payload-encryption[Hyperwallet's API]. This payload encryption feature is based on https://jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[JOSE] and https://jwt.io/[JWT].

If you need further information, consult the https://docs.hyperwallet.com/content/api/v4/overview/payload-encryption[Hyperwallet v4 API reference documentation].

### Setting up JWK key sets

To communicate with the connector Hyperwallet needs to retrieve a jwk key set and this set of keys should be published
in an endpoint with a valid TLS certificate, it is needed that you generate one key for signing and another one for
encrypting the messages.

You can generate the keys via this website: https://mkjwk.org/

Supported sign algorithms (JWS):

- RS256, RS384, RS512
- PS256, PS384, PS512
- ES256, ES384, ES512

Supported JWE encryption algorithms are:

- RSA-OAEP-256
- ECDH-ES, ECDH-ES+A128KW, ECDH-ES+A192KW, ECDH-ES+A256KW

Once you have generated both keys you need create 2 files, one with only the public keys and another one containing both
public and private keys, like the following examples

Modify accordingly all the environment variables related with the encryption feature:
|===
| NAME|ACCEPTED VALUES
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_KEY_SET_LOCATION`| Hyperwallet's key set uri. Default value is `https://uat-api.paylution.com/jwkset`. 

For pointing to production, replace the value by `https://api.paylution.com/jwkset` with `https://uat-api.paylution.com/jwkset`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM`|`RSA-OAEP-256`, `ECDH-ES`, `ECDH-ES+A128KW`, `ECDH-ES+A192KW`, `ECDH-ES+A256KW`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_SIGN_ALGORITHM`| `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512` 
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_ENCRYPTION_METHOD`| `A128CBC-HS256`, `A192CBC-HS384`, `A256CBC-HS512`, `A128GCM`, `A192GCM`, `A256GCM`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PRIVATE_JWK_JSON_LOCATION`| The private and public JWK set location `/your/path/to/private/keys/jwk_set.key`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PUBLIC_JWK_JSON_LOCATION`| Connector's  public JWK set location `/your/path/to/public/keys/jwk_set.key`
|===


Following this previous example, the environment variables values for UAT would be:
|===
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_KEY_SET_LOCATION`          | `https://uat-api.paylution.com/jwkset`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM`      | `RSA-OAEP-256`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_SIGN_ALGORITHM`            | `RS256`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_ENCRYPTION_METHOD`         | `A256CBC-HS512`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PRIVATE_JWK_JSON_LOCATION` | `/your/path/to/private/keys/jwk_set.key`
|`PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PUBLIC_JWK_JSON_LOCATION`  | `/your/path/to/public/keys/jwk_set.key` 
|===

By default, and under the encrypted profile, the connector allows you to share your public keys throughout this
endpoint: ```/jwkset```

Take into account that this file can also be published in a different server than the connector (
like an S3 bucket) and you'll simply need to modify the `hyperwallet.api.hmcPublicKeyLocation` with the proper URL where
this file is published.

[IMPORTANT]
Publish publicly only the PUBLIC keys JSON file

For enabling the encryption payload feature you will also need to enable in `application.properties`
file the profile `encrypted`, e.g. for a development machine:

`spring.profiles.active=dev,encrypted`

Notice also that Hyperwallet enables the possibility of having the webhook notifications encrypted, if you have asked
this feature to be enabled, the connector will take care of decrypting the notifications whenever the
profile `encrypted` is set.

## Other endpoints

### Health check

The connector exposes via `spring-boot-actuator` library a health check endpoint under route `/actuator/health` that
will return an object like this whenever the server is up and running:

....
{
  "status": "UP"
}
....

### Build and app information

For knowing the version of the connector you're running you can also query the URL `/actuator/info`
to return a version object:

....
{
  "app": {
    "name": "Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector",
    "description": "Drop in connector for interconnecting Mirakl and Hyperwallet systems"
  },
  "build": {
    "artifact": "web",
    "name": "web",
    "time": "2021-06-25T12:55:52.428Z",
    "version": "release-3.0-5-ga3d1009.dirty",
    "group": "com.paypal"
  }
}
....

## Health Checks

### Startup Check System

During the startup the connector does a series of checks to ensure that it's configured correctly and that is ready
to be used.

This is the list of checks that are performed during startup:

- Mirakl custom fields schema
- Mirakl documents
- Hyperwallet API connectivity
- Mirakl API connectivity

The startup check system will generate a report for each individual check, reporting the issues found during each
individual check and the final status for each check. It will also generate a summary status aggregating the status
of each individual check. The possible status are the following:

** `READY`: The check has passed and no issues were found.
** `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`: The check has passed but minor issues has been found. The connector can be used but it's
recommended to solve the issues.
** `NOT_READY`: The check has not passed because at least one severe issue has been found. You must solve the issue
before using the connector in production.

The aggregated status of all the individual checks is always the most severe status. For example if one check is
`READY_WITH_WARNINGS` and the rest of them are `READY` the overall status will be `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`.

By default, the connector will continue working even when the aggregated report status is `NOT_READY` but this can
be changed by setting to true the `PAYPAL_HMC_STARTUPCHECKS_EXITONFAIL` environment variable.

This is a sample startup check report:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.209 [main] WARN   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check Report -> Status: <READY_WITH_WARNINGS>. Dumping individual checks:

....

First it shows the overall status:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.209 [main] WARN   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check Report -> Status: <READY_WITH_WARNINGS>. Dumping individual checks:

Then there is a log entry for each individual check:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.211 [main] INFO   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklHealthCheck>, Status <READY>, CheckDetails:

status: UP
location: https://hyperwallet2-dev.mirakl.net/api
version: 3.213
....

As it can be seen in the examples the log level is directly related to the status:

** `READY`: It's printed with INFO level
** `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`: It's printed with WARNING level
** `NOT_READY`: It's printed with ERROR level

There are some complex checks (for example custom fields) that makes multiple checks, in that cases in the log each
individual issue found is printed:

....

### Mirakl custom fields schema check

Custom field schema startup checks ensures that the custom fields expected by the definition exists and their definition
is the expected.

This check only takes into account custom fields whose code starts with `hw-` which is the prefix used for all the
custom fields used by the connector. It does three checks:

** It checks that the required custom fields exists in Mirakl.
** It checks that there aren't unexpected custom fields in Mirakl. Since the system only takes into account `hw-`
prefixed fields this won't conflict with other custom fields that can exists in Mirakl for other purposes.
** It checks the properties of each individual field to see if they are correct.

Each issue found will have a different severity:

** Field not found, this is a severe issue.
** Unexpected field found, this is only a warning.
** Custom field property doesn't have the expected definition. In this case it depends on the property that doesn't have
the expected definition:
  *** Incorrect type, this is a severe issue. For example the field should be a list but is a boolean.
  *** Incorrect permissions, this is a severe issue. For example the field shouldn't be visible to the sellers, but it's visible.
  *** Incorrect regexp, this is a severe issue. A different regular expression than the expected has been found.
  *** Incorrect allowed values, this is a severe issue. For example the field is a list and it should allow ONE and TWO values, but in Mirakl it allows ONE, TWO, THREE.
  *** Incorrect label, this is only a warning.
  *** Incorrect description, this is only a warning.
  *** Incorrect required value, this is only a warning. For example the field `hw-terms-consent` is expected to not be required but in Mirakl is required. (Required value refers to if the field should be filled to be able to save changes in Mirakl backoffice)

The final status of this check depends on the aggregated results of each individual checks:

** `READY`: no issues were found.
** `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`: no severe issues were found, but at least one warning was found.
** `NOT_READY`: at least one severe issues was found.

Each individual issue found is printed into the log, like in this example:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.214 [main] WARN   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklCustomFieldsSchemaCheck>, Status <READY_WITH_WARNINGS>, CheckDetails:
Item 'hw-bankaccount-token' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'description' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'Auto-generated, DO NOT change this value. This is a unique identifier for this Seller/Payee's bank account in Hyperwallet.'
Actual value: 'Auto-generated, DO NOT change this value.  This is a unique identifier for this Seller/Payee's bank account in Hyperwallet.'
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
---------
Item 'hw-stakeholder-government-id-count-3' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'label' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'Government ID country code'
Actual value: 'Government ID country code '
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
---------
Item 'hw-stakeholder-city-4' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'label' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'City'
Actual value: ' City'
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
....

For each individual issue in addition to the details of the issue the severity of the issue is also print:

** `Severity: RECOMMENDATION`: This means that the issue is only a warning, it's recommended to update the definition
of the custom field, but it's not mandatory.
** `Severity: BLOCKER`: This means that this is a severe issue that can cause the connector to not work properly. Is
mandatory to fix the issue.

For unexpected field definitions issues the log message is the following:

....
Item 'hw-stakeholder-city-4' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'label' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'City'
Actual value: ' City'
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
....

It shows:

** The custom field that have a property with incorrect definition.
** The name of the property.
** The value expected by the connector.
** The actual value found in Mirakl.

For field not founds issues the log message is the following:

....
Expected field 'hw-program' has not been found
Offending field details: MiraklField(label=Hyperwallet Program, code=hw-program, description=Your Hyperwallet implementation may consist of one or more programs based on your payout needs. Select the appropriate program for this Seller/Payee., type=SINGLE_VALUE_LIST, permissions=INVISIBLE, required=null, regexpPattern=null, allowedValues=[])
Severity: BLOCKER
....

It shows:

** The custom field that wasn't found.
** The details of the field including the expected value for each property.

For unexpected fields the log message is the following:

....
An unexpected field named 'hw-program-old' has been found
Offending field details: MiraklField(label=Hyperwallet Program, code=hw-program, description=Your Hyperwallet implementation may consist of one or more programs based on your payout needs. Select the appropriate program for this Seller/Payee., type=SINGLE_VALUE_LIST, permissions=INVISIBLE, required=null, regexpPattern=null, allowedValues=[])
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
....

It shows:

** The custom field that was unexpectedly found.
** The details of the field including the value for each property that was retrieved from Mirakl.

### Mirakl documents check

This is only used for very specific deployments that need to check the custom documents in Mirakl. By default, is not
going to do anything.

### Hyperwallet API connectivity

This check tests if Hyperwallet API is accessible and if the configuration (user/password) is correct. To do this
check the connector makes a request to the `/programs` Hyperwallet endpoint and tries to retrieve the token specified
by the variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKEN_USERS_DEFAULT`.

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.212 [main] INFO   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <hyperwalletHealthCheck>, Status <READY>, CheckDetails:
Hyperwallet API is accessible
status: UP
location: https://server.hyperwallet.com/
....

In case of error it will display the error message returned by the Hyperwallet SDK.

### Mirakl API connectivity

This check tests if Mirakl API is accessible and if the configuration (access token) is correct. To do this check
the connector makes a request to V01 Health Check Endpoint of Mirakl that returns the version of Mirakl.

The log shows the following:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.211 [main] INFO   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklHealthCheck>, Status <READY>, CheckDetails:
Mirakl API is accessible
status: UP
location: https://server.mirakl.net/api
version: 3.213
....

In case of error it will display the error message returned by the Mirakl SDK.

### Spring Boot Actuator Health Check

The connector exposes via `spring-boot-actuator` library a health check endpoint under route `/actuator/health` that
will return an object like this whenever the server is up and running:

....
{
  "status": "DOWN",
  "components": {
    "db": {
      "status": "UP",
      "components": {

It shows each individual health check and the aggregated health check status. In addition to the health checks provided
by Spring Boot it also shows `miraklAPIHealthCheck` and `hyperwalletAPIHealthCheck` which are the same checks made
during the startup check.

The example check shown before has a `DOWN` status because one of the dependencies, the mail system, is not accessible.
If you are only interested in knowing if the connector is up, you can look only at `ping` check.
