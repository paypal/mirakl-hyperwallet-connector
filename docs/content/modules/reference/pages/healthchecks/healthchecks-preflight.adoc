== Preflight startup checks

During the startup the connector does a series of checks to ensure that it's ready to be work. It does the following checks:

* Mirakl custom fields schema
* Mirakl documents
* Hyperwallet API connectivity
* Mirakl API connectivity

The startup check system generates a report for each individual check, showing the issues founds and the check status. It also generates an summary status aggregating each individual check. The possible status are the following:

* `READY`: The check has passed and no issues were found.
* `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`: The check has passed but minor issues were found. The connector can be used but it's recommended to solve the issues.
* `NOT_READY`: The check hasn't passed because at least one severe issue was found. You must solve the issue before using the connector in production.

The aggregated status of all the individual checks is the most severe status. For example if one check is `READY_WITH_WARNINGS` and the others are `READY`, then the summary status is `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`.

By default, the connector continues working even when the aggregated report status is `NOT_READY`. This can be changed by setting to true the `PAYPAL_HMC_STARTUPCHECKS_EXITONFAIL` environment variable.

The following is an example of a startup check report:

....

....

First it shows the summary status:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.209 [main] WARN   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check Report -> Status: <READY_WITH_WARNINGS>. Dumping individual checks:
....

Then there is a log entry for each individual check:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.211 [main] INFO   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklHealthCheck>, Status <READY>, CheckDetails:
Mirakl API is accessible
status: UP
location: https://hyperwallet2-dev.mirakl.net/api
version: 3.213
....

As it's shown in the examples, the log level is directly related to the status:

** `READY`: It's printed with INFO level
** `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`: It's printed with WARNING level
** `NOT_READY`: It's printed with ERROR level

There are some complex checks (for example custom fields) that makes multiple checks, in that cases in the log each individual issue found is printed:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.214 [main] WARN   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklCustomFieldsSchemaCheck>, Status <READY_WITH_WARNINGS>, CheckDetails:

=== Mirakl custom fields schema check

Custom field schema startup checks ensures that the custom fields expected by the definition exists and their definition is the expected.

This check only takes into account custom fields whose code starts with `hw-` which is the prefix used for all the custom fields used by the connector. It does three checks:

* It checks that the required custom fields exists in Mirakl.
* It checks that there aren't unexpected custom fields in Mirakl. Since the system only takes into account `hw-` prefixed fields this won't conflict with other custom fields that can exists in Mirakl for other purposes.
* It checks the properties of each individual field to see if they are correct.

Each issue found has a different severity:

* Field not found, this is a severe issue.
* Unexpected field found, this is only a warning.
* Custom field property doesn't have the expected definition. In this case it depends on the property that doesn't have
the expected definition:
  ** Wrong type, this is a severe issue. For example the field should be a list but is a boolean.
  ** Wrong permissions, this is a severe issue. For example the field shouldn't be visible to the sellers, but it's visible.
  ** Wrong regexp, this is a severe issue. A different regular expression than the expected has been found.
  ** Wrong allowed values, this is a severe issue. For example the field is a list and it should allow ONE and TWO values, but in Mirakl it allows ONE, TWO, THREE.
  ** Wrong label, this is only a warning.
  ** Wrong description, this is only a warning.
  ** Wrong required value, this is only a warning. For example the field `hw-terms-consent` is expected to not be required but in Mirakl is required. (Required value refers to if the field should be filled to be able to save changes in Mirakl backoffice)

The final status of this check depends on the aggregated results of each individual checks:

* `READY`: no issues were found.
* `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`: no severe issues were found, but at least one warning was found.
* `NOT_READY`: at least one severe issues was found.

Each individual issue found is printed into the log, like in this example:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.214 [main] WARN   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklCustomFieldsSchemaCheck>, Status <READY_WITH_WARNINGS>, CheckDetails:
Item 'hw-bankaccount-token' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'description' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'Auto-generated, DO NOT change this value. This is a unique identifier for this Seller/Payee's bank account in Hyperwallet.'
Actual value: 'Auto-generated, DO NOT change this value.  This is a unique identifier for this Seller/Payee's bank account in Hyperwallet.'
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
---------
Item 'hw-stakeholder-government-id-count-3' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'label' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'Government ID country code'
Actual value: 'Government ID country code '
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
---------
Item 'hw-stakeholder-city-4' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'label' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'City'
Actual value: ' City'
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
....

For each individual issue in addition to the details of the issue the severity of the issue is also print:

** `Severity: RECOMMENDATION`: This means that the issue is only a warning, it's recommended to update the definition
of the custom field, but it's not mandatory.
** `Severity: BLOCKER`: This means that this is a severe issue that can cause the connector to not work properly. Is mandatory to fix the issue.

For unexpected field definitions issues the log message is the following:

....
Item 'hw-stakeholder-city-4' doesn't have the expected definition.
Property 'label' doesn't have the correct value.
Expected value: 'City'
Actual value: ' City'
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
....

It shows:

** The custom field that have a property with a wrong definition.
** The name of the property.
** The value expected by the connector.
** The actual value found in Mirakl.

For field not founds issues the log message is the following:

....
Expected field 'hw-program' has not been found
Offending field details: MiraklField(label=Hyperwallet Program, code=hw-program, description=Your Hyperwallet implementation may consist of one or more programs based on your payout needs. Select the appropriate program for this Seller/Payee., type=SINGLE_VALUE_LIST, permissions=INVISIBLE, required=null, regexpPattern=null, allowedValues=[])
Severity: BLOCKER
....

It shows:

* The custom field that wasn't found.
* The details of the field including the expected value for each property.

For unexpected fields the log message is the following:

....
An unexpected field named 'hw-program-old' has been found
Offending field details: MiraklField(label=Hyperwallet Program, code=hw-program, description=Your Hyperwallet implementation may consist of one or more programs based on your payout needs. Select the appropriate program for this Seller/Payee., type=SINGLE_VALUE_LIST, permissions=INVISIBLE, required=null, regexpPattern=null, allowedValues=[])
Severity: RECOMMENDATION
....

It shows:

* The custom field that was unexpectedly found.
* The details of the field including the value for each property that was retrieved from Mirakl.

=== Mirakl documents check

This check is only useful for uncommon deployments that need to check the custom documents in Mirakl. By default, by default it doesn't do anything.

=== Hyperwallet API connectivity

This check tests if Hyperwallet API is accessible and if the configuration (user/password) is correct. To do this check the connector makes a request to the `/programs` Hyperwallet endpoint and tries to retrieve the token specified by the variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_PROGRAM_TOKEN_USERS_DEFAULT`.

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.212 [main] INFO   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <hyperwalletHealthCheck>, Status <READY>, CheckDetails:
Hyperwallet API is accessible
status: UP
location: https://server.hyperwallet.com/
....

In case of error it will display the error message returned by the Hyperwallet SDK.

=== Mirakl API connectivity

This check tests if Mirakl API is accessible and if the configuration (access token) is correct. To do this check the connector makes a request to V01 Health Check Endpoint of Mirakl that returns the version of Mirakl.

The log shows the following:

....
22-07-2022 14:54:47.211 [main] INFO   StartupCheckerService.java - Startup Check: <miraklHealthCheck>, Status <READY>, CheckDetails:
Mirakl API is accessible
status: UP
location: https://server.mirakl.net/api
version: 3.213
....

In case of error it will display the error message returned by the Mirakl SDK.
