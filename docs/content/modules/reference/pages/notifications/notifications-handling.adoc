== Storing and filtering

Hyperwallet API doesn't guarantee the order of the notifications received for a specific item (seller, stakeholder, paymentâ€¦). This could cause issues like changing the KYC status of sellers that were already verified.

To avoid such issues, and following Hyperwallet recommendations, the connector stores the notifications received and filter out the obsolete and duplicated ones.

=== Behaviour

When then connector receives a notification it stores it in a database, except for two different cases:

* Duplicated notification: the same notification already received and stored in the database
* Obsolete notification: a notification for the same item (a specific seller, stakeholder...), but created before the existing one already stored in the database.

The connector stores the following information in the `NotificationEntity` table:

|===
| Database field | Data type | Notes

|`id` |Long | Autogenerated ID
|`webhookToken` |String |Token of the notification
|`objectToken`  |String |Token of the related item
|`creationDate` |Date |Creation date of the notification by Hyperwallet
|`receptionDate` |Date |Date of reception of the notification in the connector
|`notificationType` |String |Type of the notification, containing one of the following possible values: USR, PMT, STK, TRM, UNK

|===

The connector extracts the notification type from the three first characters of its token. The possible values are:

* `USR`: Sellers
* `STK`: Stakeholders
* `PMT`: Payments (invoices)
* `TRM`: Bank account
* `UNK`: Unknown

Hyperwallet never sends an unknown type notification, however, if the connector can't parse the notification token stores this value to avoid a failure.

=== Querying and housekeeping

Two different endpoints are available to query or to remove the notifications stored in the database.

|===
| Endpoint | Method | Description

|`/webhooks/notifications` |GET |Query the notifications stored in the database
|`/webhooks/notifications` |DELETE |Remove the notifications stored in the database

|===

The endpoints receives two parameters (`from` and `to`) query or remove the notifications received within such period. The connector doesn't offer a job to remove the notifications automatically, and the user is responsible on triggering (manually or automatically).

Example of valid execution request for both querying and removing notifications:

....
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/webhooks/notifications?from=2021-04-27T10:30:00.000-00:00&to=2023-04-27T10:30:00.000-00:00'

curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/webhooks/notifications?from=2021-04-27T10:30:00.000-00:00&to=2023-04-27T10:30:00.000-00:00'
....
