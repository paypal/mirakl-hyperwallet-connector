== Retry mechanism

The connector retries the processing of the notifications received from Hyperwallet in case it's impossible to upload the information in Mirakl. 

=== Functionality behaviour

The connector uses an internal database to support the retry functionality without storing sensitive information. A periodical job retrieve such notifications from Hyperwallet and then try to update Mirakl again until they reach the maximum number of attempts allowed.

When a failed notification is stored in the database and a new one is received, the connector checks the following cases:

* *Identical existing notification*, the connector skips the notification, as it's identical to the previous one.
* *Updated existing notification*, the connector receives a notification for the same item (e.g a user) with a creation date later than the one stored. In this cases the connector process the received notification and drops the old one.
* *Outdated existing notification*, the connector receives a notification for the same item (e.g a user) with a creation date before the stored one. In this cases the connector ignores the received notification.

When all retry attempts for a notification are exahusted, the connector removes it from the database and sends an email to the operator.

=== Configuration

The connector reads the configuration from the following configuration variables:

* `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_RETRY_NOTIFICATIONS`, set to `true` to enable retries, or `false` to deactivate them. Set to `true` by default.

* `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_MAX_AMOUNT_OF_NOTIFICATION_RETRIES`, determines the maximum number of attempts allowed for each notification. Set to `5` by default

* `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_RETRY_FAILED_NOTIFICATIONS_CRON_EXPRESSION`, used to configure the periodicity of the retry job.

=== Email alerts

The connector sends an email to the operator when all the retries of a notification fails. The email includes the following details:

....
Subject: [HMC] Technical error occurred when processing the notification <NOTIFICATION_TOKEN>

Body: There was an error processing the notification <NOTIFICATION_TOKEN> and the operation could not be completed. The maximum number of attempts <NOTIFICATION_TOKEN> has been reached, therefore it will not try to re-process the notification anymore. Please check the logs for further information.
