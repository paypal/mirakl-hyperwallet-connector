## Job types

The connector executes two types of jobs:

* Extract jobs: these jobs extract data from Mirakl and then process the extracted items.
* Retry jobs: these jobs extracts data from an internal store of failed items and then process the extracted items.

Extract and retry jobs apply the same logic to process the extracted items. The only difference is the source of the extracted items. The section xref:jobs/generic-job#generic-job-retry[about retries] provides more information about the retry processes.
