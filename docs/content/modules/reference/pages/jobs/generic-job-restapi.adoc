== Jobs REST API

The existing jobs can be executed manually through their endpoints. Except for notification retry job, which doesn't receive
any parameter, all endpoints support 2 optional parameters:

* `delta`: When provided for an extract job, the job will only process entities that were updated/created after this
  date
* `name` : When provided, the job will be given this name
