= Seller onboarding

This workflow enables to onboard sellers in Hyperwallet by creating users and bank accounts in Hyperwallet, and updating the KYC status in Mirakl.

The steps for onboarding a seller are the following:

* The seller creates a shop in Mirakl entering the bank account information for receiving the payments.
* The connector runs the seller extraction job, creating or updating the user in Hyperwallet.
* The connector runs the extract bank account job, creating or updating the bank account in Hyperwallet.
* Hyperwallet customer team gets in contact with the seller through his contact information to start the KYC process.
* Hyperwallet notifies to the connector the progress of the KYC process, and the connector updates the KYC status in Mirakl.

The connector can run the extraction jobs automatically through a configurable schedule, or the user can run the jobs manually using the job API.
