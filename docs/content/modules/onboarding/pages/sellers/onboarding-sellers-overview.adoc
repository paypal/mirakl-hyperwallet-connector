= Sellers extraction

The sellers extraction jobs retrieves changed shops from Mirakl and creates or updates the corresponding user in Hyperwallet.

Based on the seller's type, the connector provides two different jobs:

- Individual sellers extraction job.
- Professional sellers extraction job.

NOTE: What's described here applies to both professional and individual sellers extraction jobs.

== Characteristics

* The connector supports individual and professional sellers, providing a different job for each type. The difference between them is the data read from the shop in Mirakl and the data required to create the user in Hyperwallet.
* A seller can create more than one shop in Mirakl, for example, to sell in different currencies. In this case, the connector exports each shop as a separate user in Hyperwallet as if they were different sellers.
* Sellers need to accept Hyperwallet's terms and conditions in Mirakl. The connector filter outs shops that doesn't have the custom field `Hyperwallet Ts & Cs and Privacy Policy consent` set to `yes`.
