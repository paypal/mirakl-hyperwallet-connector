[#country-currency-selection]
== Country and currency selection

Hyperwallet API defines the supported countries and currencies combinations, and based on them, it defines the bank account type that should be provided.

The bank account information that the sellers provide in Mirakl defines the bank account type and the country, which is derived from the bank account type and number according to the following rules:

* `US` for US bank accounts.
* `CA` for Canadian bank accounts.
* `GB` for UK bank accounts.
* First two characters of the bank account number for IBAN bank accounts.

Using the bank account information and Hyperwallet's country/currency combinations, the connector determines the currency that should be used for the transfer using the following logic:

[mermaid,bankaccount-currency-selection]
....
flowchart TB
    s0(Extract bank account country and type<br/>from Mirakl shop's information)
    s1{{Hyperwallet supports marketplace currency<br/>for bank account country and type in Mirakl?}}
    s2(Use marketplace's currency<br/>in Hyperwallet bank account)
    s3(Use another compatible currency<br/>in Hyperwallet bank account)    
    s0 --> s1
    s1 --> |Yes|s2
    s1 --> |No|s3
....

Automatic currency selection can be disabled setting to `false`` the environment variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_BANK_ACCOUNTS_ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_CURRENCY_SELECTION`. In this case marketplace's currency is always used during bank account creation, that will fail when the currency isn't supported by Hyperwallet.
