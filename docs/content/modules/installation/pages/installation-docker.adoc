== Run the connector with docker

With this setup worflow you will generate a docker image that can be used to run the connector and that it's easily exportable to other environments.

=== Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

=== Building the connector

. Clone the GitHub repository of the project:

 $ git clone https://github.com/paypal/mirakl-hyperwallet-connector.git

. Set up build required environment variables
. Execute build script:

 $ ./gradlew clean build

=== Creating a docker image

. Create the docker image 

 $ ./gradlew hmc-app:bootBuildImage

=== Running the docker container

. Create an `.env` file with the environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.sample` as a reference

. Start the connector with docker using this command (change `X.Y.Z`` with the version of the connector, e.g. `5.0.0`)

 $ docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 hyperwallet-mirakl-connector:X.Y.Z

TIP: If needed, you can also map the volumes for the folders described at the begining of the page and for the encryption keys.

=== Running the docker container with docker compose

. Create a docker compose file

 $ ./gradlew buildDockerCompose -Pprod=true

NOTE: You can also generate a docker compose file for development or testing purposes by omitting `-Pprod=true`. This docker compose file will also launch additional dependencies like mail server so you don't need to setup one.

. Create an `.env` file with the environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.sample` as a reference

. Start the connector with docker compose using this command

 $ docker-compose up

TIP: If needed, you can also edit the generated docker-compose file to change the volume mappings.
