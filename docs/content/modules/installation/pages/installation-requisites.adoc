== Requirements

Installing and running the connector requires the following:

- Java 17 JDK
- A Linux Environment
- A mail server for sending alerts and notifications
- A web server
- A valid SSL/TLS certificate

=== Configuration Variables for Building the Connector

The connector uses the Mirakl SDK, so the build system will need to download it from a private Maven repository owned by Mirakl. This repository is user/password protected so the build scripts need these two environment variables:

....
PAYPAL_MIRAKL_SDK_USER
PAYPAL_MIRAKL_SDK_PASSWORD
....

=== Folders

The connector stores information in the following folders:

- `./data`: Contains the connector's database. Can be customized using the environment variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_DATA_DIR`.
- `./financial-report`: Contains the financial reports generated by the connector. Can be customized using the environment variable `PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_FINANCIAL_REPORTS_OUTPUT_DIR`.
