== Building and running a binary

With this setup workflow you will build an executable JAR that you can move to the target machine where you want to execute the connector. This allows you to build only one time and reuse the binary for multiple environment (like your pre production and production environment).

=== Building the connector

. Clone the GitHub repository of the project:

 $ git clone https://github.com/paypal/mirakl-hyperwallet-connector.git

. Set up build required environment variables
. Execute build script:

 $ ./gradlew clean build

After this steps the connector is ready to run.

=== Creating executable JAR file

The first step for having the connector up and running is building it from source code.

* `./gradlew clean build bootJar`

It will generate a file named hmc-app-X.Y.Z.jar in the `./hmc-app/build/libs` directory.

=== Running executable JAR file

. Execute the JAR using Java:

 $ java -jar hmc-app-X.Y.Z.jar
