== Hyperwallet preparation tasks

. Whitelist in Hyperwallet your server IPs, so the connector can make request to the Hyperwallet API.
. Configure in Hyperwallet connector's URL for receiving webhook notifications. The connector listens for notifications in `/webhooks/notifications` path.
. Whitelist in your infrastructure Hyperwallet servers IP addresses (69.172.255.0/24 and 38.70.198.0/24) so notifications can reach the connector server.
