# Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector Readme

The Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector (HMC) is a service that integrates the Hyperwallet and Mirakl platforms.

## Setting up jobs

The Hyperwallet Mirakl Connector runs jobs to perform various integrations between the Hyperwallet and Mirakl platforms.

* `Individual sellers extract job`: Extracts the individual seller information from Mirakl and creates it on Hyperwallet.
* `Professional sellers extract job`: Extracts the professional seller information from Mirakl and creates it on
  Hyperwallet.
* `Bank Accounts extract job`: Extracts the bank detail information from sellers and creates a bank on account
  Hyperwallet associated to the corresponding user in Hyperwallet.
* `Invoices extract job`: Extracts the bank detail information from sellers and creates a bank on account
  Hyperwallet associated to the corresponding user in Hyperwallet.
* `Failed notifications retry job`: Retries all of the notifications sent from Hyperwallet that failed while being processed.

Those jobs are currently setup across the properties file as this table follows:

|===
|Property|Cron expression|Properties file
| `sellers.extractsellers.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 0 0 1/1 * ? *   | `sellers/src/main/resources/sellers.properties`             
| `sellers.extractprofessionalsellers.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 0 0 1/1 * ? *   | `sellers/src/main/resources/sellers.properties`             
| `sellers.bankaccountextract.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 30 0 1/1 * ? *  | `sellers/src/main/resources/sellers.properties`             
| `invoices.extractinvoices.scheduling.cronexpression`| 1 0 0 1/1 * ? *   | `invoices/src/main/resources/invoices.properties`           
| `notifications.retryfailed.scheduling.cronexpression`| 0 0/15 * * * ? *  | `notifications/src/main/resources/notifications.properties` 
|===

The existing jobs can be executed manually through their endpoints. Except for notification retry job, which doesn't receive
any parameter, all endpoints support 2 optional parameters:

* `delta`: When provided for an extract job, the job will only process entities that were updated/created after this
  date
* `name` : When provided, the job will be given this name


|===
|Param|Format
|`name`| String
|`delta`| yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX

## Webhook Notifications

The Hyperwallet platform is capable of sending event notifications via webhook. This connector comes with a built-in
listener to process supported webhook notification types, and works with both basic authentication and payload
encryption.

The endpoint for the webhook listener is on the path: `/webhooks/notifications`. This path is used by default, and no
properties or configuration are used for enabling or setting up the webhook listener.

During the on-boarding process, Hyperwallet will enable webhook notifications by registering the webhook listener
endpoint URL (for example, https://hmc.example.com/webhooks/notifications).

Storing and querying notifications:

The connector stores the incoming notifications, these can be retrieved and deleted using these endpoints.
A `from` and a `to` date parameters must be provided in both operations.
|===
| HTTP Method | PATH                      | Params                                                              | Description                                             
| `GET`       | `/webhooks/notifications` | `from` and `to` format ISO-DATE-TIME `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` | Retrieves all the notifications between the given dates 
| `DELETE`    | `/webhooks/notifications` | `from` and `to` format ISO-DATE-TIME `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` | Deletes all the notifications between the given dates
