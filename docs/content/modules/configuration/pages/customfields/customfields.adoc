= Mirakl Custom Fields Creation

Mirakl custom fields allows you to extend the Mirakl shop data model with new fields, that can also be edited from the Mirakl backend. The connector makes use of custom fields to:

- Store internal required data to link Mirakl information with Hyperwallet.
- Store additional information required by Hyperwallet not available in Mirakl (like the bank account state)

Before using the connector, you need to create in Mirakl the custom fields required by the connector. You can create custom fields from Mirakl backoffice in the +++Settings+++ > +++Advanced parameters+++ > +++Shops+++ section as explained in this https://help.mirakl.net/bundle/customers/page/topics/Mirakl/mmp/Operator/config_custom_fields/config_custom_fields.html[guide].

The connector will check at the startup if all the fields are created correctly, as explained here.
