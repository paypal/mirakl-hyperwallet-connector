The Hyperwallet-Mirakl Connector (HMC) is a drop-in service that interconnects Mirakl and Hyperwallet providing payout connectivity between them.

It's designed to be easy to install and operate, providing self-healing features and a mail based alerting system. The connector xref:reference:/features/features.adoc[supports the following workflows]:
